# Rhythm Game
Ladies and gentlemen we are back once again creating another game in java, and of course still using libGDX.
This was my ISC4U culminating and I would say that my code has somewhat improved, definitely less spaghetti now.
Learned a lot more about the framework and the game actually looks pretty decent I would say. I probably should
code more not going to lie.
